# React +  Node.js Microservices with Event Sourcing
A simple project using Node.js as event bus/store.

To install all dependencies run `npm run install-all` from the root directory.
To run `npm run start-all-service`
To run then query service `cd query && npm start`

I separate the query service when running all services so we can test the event syncing.
